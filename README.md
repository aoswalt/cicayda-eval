**Leap Years**

Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years

**Framing**

Write a function that takes a list of strings and prints them, once per
line, in a rectangular frame.

Example: the list `["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"]` gets printed
as:

```
*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********
```

**Pig Latin**

Write a function that translates text to Pig Latin and back.

English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every
word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’.  “The quick
brown fox” becomes “Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay”.
